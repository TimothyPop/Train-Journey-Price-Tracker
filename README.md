This Train Journey Tracker application monitors train ticket prices for specific journeys and sends alerts when prices drop below a user-set threshold. The backend is built with Java (Spring Boot), and the frontend is developed using Angular.

Key Features:

Price Alerts: Users can set a price threshold, and the app automatically notifies them when prices drop below the set value.
Scheduler: The app frequently checks train ticket prices using a scheduler, ensuring users receive timely updates and alerts.
Manual Refresh: Users can manually refresh the prices for specific journeys, instantly retrieving the most up-to-date information.
Historical Data: Displays historical price data, allowing users to track trends and optimize their travel decisions.
The backend is hosted on AWS EC2, with the frontend deployed on AWS S3, and data is stored in a PostgreSQL RDS instance.
