Key features include:

Price Alert System: The app frequently checks current ticket prices using a scheduler and automatically notifies users (with an email) when prices fall below their chosen threshold.
Real-Time Refresh: Watch the demo as I showcase the "refresh" feature, allowing users to manually refresh the price of a specific journey and get instant updates on the latest price.
The backend uses a scheduler to ensure frequent and automated checks, so users can plan their travels efficiently and save money with minimal effort.
